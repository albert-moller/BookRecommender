# GoodReads Recommendation system

## To-Do List
- [x] `Goodreads dataset`: Write web scraping code to create Goodreads dataset.
- [ ] `Apriori`: Implement `Apriori` algorithm from scratch and assert that it gives the same output as `mlxtend.frequent_patters.apriori` 
- [ ] `PCY`: Implement `PCY` algorithm from scratch and assert that it gives the same output as another python package.
- [ ] `K-means`: Implement `K-means` clustering.
- [ ] `DBSCAN`: Implement `DBSCAN` clustering.
- [ ] `Metrics`: Implement metrics to quantify the performance of Goodreads recommendation system using `Aprior`, `PCY`, `K-means` and `DBSCAN`.
- [ ] `Topic not taught in class`: Implement a topic / metric / algorithm not taught in class.
